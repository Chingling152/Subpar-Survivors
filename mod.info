description=You will find other Survivors to join you. They'll always be subpar compared to multiplayer, but they can still add a lot to the game.

description=This is an extension of nolanritchie's Superb Survivors. I've optimized it to reduce the performance impact, and added some balance changes and fixes to the AI routines to behave better. Also includes bugfixes for most of the in-game errors I've encountered, and improved compatibility with Gunfighter and Brita's.

description=You must have Superb Survivors activated first before activating this mod. Build 41 is required.

description=It is suggested that you start a new save when enabling this mod. If you add it to an existing save with Superb Survivors, it will delete any Survivors from that game.
